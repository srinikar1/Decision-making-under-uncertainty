# Decision-making-under-uncertainty
A research project looking at clinical drug development.

New drug development is a resource intensive activity that requires complex decision making to balance cost, time and risk.

It is highly regulated with many development activities subject to well defined inputs and outputs.

This project looks to model the drug development process to assist decision making to opitmise outcomes.
