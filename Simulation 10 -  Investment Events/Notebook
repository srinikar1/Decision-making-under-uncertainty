Implement connection relationship
implement block status (ready > starting > running > waiting)
implement block precdence logic to await for all required blocks to complete first
Run the simulation until the last block complete
    set the scenartion time to the current day when all the blocks are complete
    fixed the sequencing to account for blocks strting and completing

    Implemented write to file
    Implements revenue (Market potential)

Next?: write the data to a data frame

Saturday 11 February 2023
to do - Write the csv to a data frame
done - implemented activities for each block
    need to update with final cost this does not work properly.

how do we implement transitional probability?
    first setup iterations in the model.


20230215212538 Cashflow
What is the cashflow of the simulation for one iteration?
We know the total spend for the simulation
We would like to ensure that the allocated budget can fund the development
	if more funding is allocated then development can accelerate, but 
	if the development is funded that development will proceed and generate a ROI
	if development is reduced, then development will decelerate and generate a greater ROI?

Given
    indication - ex. cardio
    transition - estimate using indication
    market size - population x cost of yearly treatment
        Potential for market failure due to earlier entrant
    Investment funding stream
        10M equity to start the project
        500M equity at the end of Phase 2
        500M funding at 8% when needed for x years 
    
What types of decisions exist for the following:

    When should manufacurting investment be made?
            at the end of a phase?
            at the begining of a phase?
            One facility or 3 large facilities?
    
    Should additional clinical trials be condusted for additional indications?
        

    
    Define the objective function?
            At the end of the project,  the ccf = zero
                                        the NPV at 10% = 0

Single projects
    What is the impact on profitability by concurrent development

Multiple projects

portfolio projects

Start by assuming that the project will succed then apply uncertainty to determine impact on cashflow.

2023021764318 - fixed model create ()nameing for the blocks to prepare for investment decisions.

2023021784937 - cashflow works for one iteration,
Wehn runing many iterations, it does not work
It needs to accommodate for the max, min, mean, variance accross all simulations
This is now fixed. 
    Create a cashflow for one simulation
        cashflows for many simulations take took long
    Create a probability distribution for many simulations
        curve fit the probaility distribution


2023021871607 - Investment event
    There is an inital investment for x
    There may be more investments over time
    Purpose of investments is to ensure that debt does not hit a limit
    If the debt limit is reached, then additional invesment will be required.
    over time the value to x decreases
    This shoul dbe modelled over the iuteration
        Iteration has total accured cost
            Accrued cost is the sum of every block (total cost)

        Iteration should also have
